Formalize C0/C1/C2 change classification: C0 allows direct-to-main commits, C1 adds docs-first workflow with branch deployment, C2 introduces the Mikado Branch Invariant for strict commit ordering on multi-phase changes. Add C2 conventions: `C2(<chain>): plan/impl/close/finalize` commit messages, `mikado/<chain-stem>` branch naming, and `branch:` frontmatter on goal cards. New tooling: `docs-mikado --resume` for cold-start session pickup and `mikado-branch-invariant-check` pre-commit hook.
