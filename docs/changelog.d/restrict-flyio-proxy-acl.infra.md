Restrict fly.io proxy ACLs to dedicated `tag:flyio-target` endpoints instead of broad `tag:k8s` and `tag:homelab` grants. Migrate all Tailscale Ingresses to a shared ProxyGroup with per-Ingress tag overrides (`tag:flyio-target` on docs, loki, prometheus). Add `autoApprovers` for VIP service routes. Enable `--accept-routes` on indri for ProxyGroup VIP routing.
