# Plans

Migration and transition plans for upcoming infrastructure changes. Each plan is a how-to document that captures the full context, steps, and verification criteria for a future execution session.

Plans differ from regular how-to guides in that they describe work that has been designed but not yet executed. Once a plan is completed, it moves to [[completed]].

|------|--------|-------------|
| [[migrate-forgejo-from-brew]] | Planned | Transition Forgejo from Homebrew to source-built binary with LaunchAgent |
| [[add-unifi-pulumi-stack]] | Planned | Add Pulumi IaC for UniFi Express 7 home network |
| [[upstream-fork-strategy]] | Planned | Stacked-branch forking strategy for tracking upstream projects |
| [[adopt-oidc-provider]] | Planning | Deploy OIDC identity provider for SSO across services |
| [[harden-zot-registry]] | Planned | Add authentication and tag immutability to zot registry |
| [[forgejo-actions-dashboard]] | Planned | Grafana dashboard and custom Prometheus exporter for Forgejo Actions CI metrics |
