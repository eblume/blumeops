# Plans

Migration and transition plans for upcoming infrastructure changes. Each plan is a how-to document that captures the full context, steps, and verification criteria for a future execution session.

Plans differ from regular how-to guides in that they describe work that has been designed but not yet executed. Once a plan is completed, it may be archived or converted into a standard how-to guide.

| Plan | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [[migrate-forgejo-from-brew]] | Planned | Transition Forgejo from Homebrew to source-built binary with LaunchAgent |
| [[add-unifi-pulumi-stack]] | Planned | Add Pulumi IaC for UniFi Express 7 home network |
| [[adopt-dagger-ci]] | Planned | Adopt Dagger as CI/CD build engine, migrate docs artifacts to Forgejo packages |
| [[upstream-fork-strategy]] | Planned | Stacked-branch forking strategy for tracking upstream projects |
